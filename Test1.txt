1. class variable is also called static variable.
2. A local variable stores temporary state; it is declared inside a "method".
3. 8 primitive datatypes : byte, short, int, float, long, double, bool, char
4. An "array" is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
5. A variable is a container that can be declared to hold data values/ elements of the specified datatype. 
	and can be refered to at later stages to fetch the stored value. The two types of variables are "Static and Local".
6. Datatype is a feature which defines the memory allocated by a particular type to hold a value. 
	Datatypes are byte, short, int, float, long, double, bool, char, String.
7. Rules and Naming Conventions : 
	> variable name starts with small letters and if there are many words, we use camel font to represnt 
	capital letter for each word without space.
	> variable name cannot start with capital letter, integers or symbol apart from "$" and "_".
	> variable name can end with numbers, but not symbols.
	> local variables must be initialised as soon as they are declared. Static variables can be initialised later in 
	the methods.
	> variables can hold values only of the datatype they are declared of, or lesser sized. Ex: short value can be 
	initialised for int type, double type of data cannot be stored in int type of variable.
8. The zeroth value or the empty value allocated for the datatype is its initial value:
	byte = 0 
	short = 0
	int = 0
	float = 0.0
	long = 0
	double = 0.0 
	bool = false
	char = null
	String = null

11. An array is a container which can hold many elements of similar type.
12. An array has a fixed size and vlaues cannot be initialised exceeding the size. An array can hold values only of 
	the specified type.
