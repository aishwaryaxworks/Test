1. JDK is java development kit, wich contains the libraries required for java programming. 
JVM is the Java Virtual Machine on which the java program is written. 
JRE is the Java Runtime Environment which helps in compilation of the java program by converting program to bytecode.

3. class ClassName{
		//class body
			}
4. class ClassName{
	public datatype instanceReferenceName;
		}
5. class ClassName{
	datatype[] referenceName;
	
	for (int i=0; i<=referenceName-1; i++){
			System.out.println(+referenceName[i]);
	}
}

We declare an index variable "i" and initialize it to 0. We then compare the index i with the indicies of the 
array we have considered. Depending on the conditions, after task is performed, the index i is iterated.

6. Logical operators: 
a. AND operator - is true when both of the operators are true.
b. OR operator - is true when any one of the operators are true.
c. NOT operator - is true when the operator dont match with each other.

7. Class is a blue print of an object which describes the properties and functions of that object.

8. Object is an instance of a class. Anything in real time, which has identity, existance and certain 
properties is an object.

9. Types of variables:
a. Static varaibles - has only one copy of values throughout the program.
b. Instance variables - the values can be changed based on the requirement of each method it is used in.
c. Local variables - they have a scope that it is available only within the method in which it is declared in.

11. Method overloading - Methods having same name but different list of parameters.
12. Method Chaining - calling one method inside another but declaring and initialising it outside that method 
is called method chaining.
13. class ClassName{
		
		accessSpecifier ClassName(parameters){
		}
}

14. Constructor is a default method that is called as soon as the class is called. It has the same name as the 
class and does not have a return type. Types of constructors :
a. Default constructor - called as soon as the class is called without intervention of user.
b. No argument constructor - same as default constructor but is modified by the user.
c. parameterized constructor - has a list of parameters that define the functions of the constructor.

15. Default constructor is called by default when a class is called. It does not need to be called by the user 
separately.
No argument Constructor does not have any arguments but its functions are modified by the user.
